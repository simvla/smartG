# smartG
"SmartG" stands for smart gardening. This code was created to monitoring data from my greenhouse and control temperature in my plant grower. <br>
I use ESP32 for development mostly, because of wifi, but it's also a powerful microcontroller no doubt, also is cheap, for example ESP32 DEV KIT boards 30 or 38 pins from china. <br>
When everything is set-up, looks like on image: <br>

Apparently the screenshot was taken from a mobile phone. Yes, that's right, there is no hardware other than the esp32 dev board and the sensor. The display is actually a mobile phone or PC browser. <br> <br>
